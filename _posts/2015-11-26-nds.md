My DS games can be played using a real DS flashcart or an emulator. It's obviously better on the actual hardware!

### Inside the Machine (NDS)
Inside the Machine is a DS game I programmed in 2007. It's a simple platformer game composed of 5 levels and 4 bosses. Most of the game is taking place inside the body of a massive creature.

### Natura no Story (NDS)
It's a platformer game with vector graphics rendered by the little DS GPU. Animations are made with Blender and exported to .MD2 (Quake II format). Running at 60fps of course.
